## _Theobroma cacao_ (clone 26) genome

#### These are the steps to assemble and annotate the diploid _Theobroma cacao_ genome.

The cacao plant is growing at the MARS research station at Pangkep, South Sulawesi. Leaf samples were taken from a  vascular streak dieback (VSD) symptomatic individual infected with _Ceratobasidium theobromae_, in January 2023. This plant (clone 26) is an F1 hybrid cross from S1 (maternal) x RUQ1347 (paternal). Peri Tobias and Jacob Downs collected the material in person and extracted HMW DNA at the UNHAS plant pathology laboratory in Makassar, with Eirene Brugman. Cross-linking was done on infected leaf material and samples sent to Phase Genomics for HiC libraries and sequencing. HMW DNA was couriered to AGRF in Brisbane, Australia (arrived 27 January 2023) for PacBio Sequel II (HiFi) sequencing. While the original intent of this research was to assemble the complete genomes of both the biotrophic pathogen and the host, we did not obtain enough sequence data to build the pathogen genome. We proceeded with the cacao tree genome of known parental cross, permitting the assigning of chromosomes as maternal and paternal.
