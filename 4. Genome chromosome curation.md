1. We ran reference-based scaffold anchoring and super-scaffolding on each of our HiC haploid scaffolded genomes independently with pafscaff, using the NCBI _Theobroma cacao_ reference genome, GCF_000403535.1_Theobroma_cacao.fasta (Matina refehttps://github.com/peritob/Theobroma-cacao-genome/tree/mainrence genome used for SNP calling for QTLs in two studies related to vascular streak dieback of cacao).

2. We concatenated the scaffolded and unplaced fasta files for a complete set of contigs for each haplotyype. These files were screened for contaminants with and all non-plant and plastid contigs removed. Attempted to assemble the mitochondira and chloroplast contigs and also all ccs reads into genomes using mitohifi, but neither built complete circularised genomes. This is possibly due to our HMW DNA extraction method that depletes cytosolic material as well as subsequent size selection for PacBio sequencing.

3. Next we ran telociraptor followed by chromsyn on just the chromosome level contigs to compare the synteny between Hap A and B.  Initially the synteny plots indicated some errors in scaffolding.

4. Then the Hap B contigmaps (T_cacao_B_v1.0.ctgmap.txt) were manually adjusted to conform with Hap A and telociraptor re-run and synteny graphs rechecked with chromsyn. After tweaking the synteny was improved.
