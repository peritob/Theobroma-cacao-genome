1. We assembled the genome with hifiasm using 30 X cocoa HiFi data in diploid mode and incoporating HiC linked reads.
   
`hifiasm -o $OUTDIR/cocoa.asm -t24 -l3 --h1 $WDIR/HiC/T_cacao_R1.fastq.gz --h2 $WDIR/HiC/T_cacao_R2.fastq.gz $WDIR/HiFi/T_cacao.filt.ccs.fastq
`

2. We then scaffolded each haploid genome output independently using all the HiC reads with the Juicer and 3D-DNA pipelines and manually corrected the heatmaps of scaffolds with Juicebox.
